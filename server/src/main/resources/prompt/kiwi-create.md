Your task is to generate a Kiwi program for based on a description. 

Kiwi is an infrastructure-free programming langauge that enables application to focus on business logic.

Here is a list of Kiwi's key features:
* Automatic object persistence
* Automatic REST API generation
* Automatic search indexing

Here is an code example:

{example}

Important Notes:

1. Unlike Kotlin, Kiwi uses `->` to denote function return type.
2. Unlike Kotlin `if-else` constructs can not be used as expressions. Use conditional expression instead.
   * For example, the following program **won't compile**:
   ```
   var max = if (a > b) a else b
   ```    
   * Change to conditional expression to fix it:
   ```
   var  max = a > b ? a : b
   ```
3. Search APIs are automatically generated. Don't try to implement it manually.
4. Array creation syntax is `new ElementType[]`, e.g., `new string[]`
5. To add an element into an array, invoke the the `append` method on the array object
6. There's no `toString` method. When concatenating objects with strings, the objects are automatically converted into string.
7. Available primitive types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string` and `bool`
8. Common methods/fields that are currently missing: array.find, array.filter, string.length. So avoid using them.
9. Parameter default values are not supported
10. `@Summary` field must be string
11. Value objects: value objects are immutable and identity-less objects. There are two common use cases for value objects:
     * Representing values in domain models, e.g., `Money`
     * As service method parameters for encapsulating complex information, e.g., `OrderPlacementRequest`
12. Smart cast is not yet supported. For example, `!!` is required in the following example even though there is a non-null check:
     ```
     fn getUserName(user: User?) -> string {
         return user != null ? user!!.name : "N/A"        
     }
    ```
13. Modifying captured variable is not yet supported. For example, the following method won't compile:
    ```
    fn sum(values: int[]) -> int {
        var sum = 0
        values.forEach(v -> sum += v)
        return sum
    }
    ```
    To resolve the issue, you can use `for-in` loop to avoid variable capturing:
    ```
    fn sum(values: int[]) -> int {
        var sum = 0
        for (v in values) sum += v
        return sum
    }
    ```
14. Only methods defined in service beans are exposed in API.
    For example, the `cancel` method below is not accessible through API:
    ```
    class Order {
       fn cancel() {
       }
    }
    ```
    To support order cancellation in API, you need to define a method in the service bean:
    ```
    @Bean
    class OrderService {
       fn cancelOrder(order: Order) {
         order.cancel()
       }
    }
    ```
15. Integration with external systems is not yet supported such as payments system or AI. 

Output Format:

The generated program shall be contained in a single source file and you shall output that source file in plain text.
Your output must ONLY contain the code. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE. No explanation, no markdown tags.
The first line shall be a line comment for application name, e.g., // Shopping, other than that, the code shall contain no comment.

Here is the description for the program to be generated:
