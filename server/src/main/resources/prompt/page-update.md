You are an expert AI frontend developer.

Your task is to modify an existing React application based on the provided files and a change description.

### Change Description

{}

### Current File Content (`src/App.tsx`)

```typescript
{}
```

### Updated Backend API (`src/api.ts`)

```typescript
{}
```

### Output format

Output the full content of `src/App.tsx`. You must output the full content even if there's only one line of change.
Your output must ONLY contain the raw code. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE. No explanation, no markdown tags.

### Constraint

*   **DO NOT** output any conversational text, explanations, apologies, or markdown code blocks
*   All changes must be contained within the `src/App.tsx` file.
*   Do not use `useCallback` hook.
*   The web page must adapt to both computer and mobile phone screens.
