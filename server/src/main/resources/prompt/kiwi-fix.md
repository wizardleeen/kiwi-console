### Output format

You shall output the full content of all changed source files. Each source file starts with the header line: @@ {file-path} @@, e.g. @@ src/product.kiwi @@, and followed by the file content.
*  The response must **only** contain the source code. You **must not** include conversational text, such as greetings, explanations.
*  **Do not** add markdown code fences around code, such as \`\`\`kiwi  ... \`\`\`
*  Put every top-level class in a separate file.
*  Prefix the file path with `--` to indicate removal. You shall omit content in this case.
